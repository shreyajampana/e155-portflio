## Lab 5: Interrupts

### Introduction
In this lab, we used our MCU to determine the speed of a motor by reading from a quadrature encoder. Lab 4 helped me get familiarized with the microcontroller and working with documentation, and this time, we tackled another aspect of microcontrollers: interrupts. Using these, I was able to process real-time, fast changes and record accurate measurements.
